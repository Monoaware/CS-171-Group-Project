## Project Description: 📁
This repository contains the final project for CS 171 (Introduction to Machine Learning) taught by Professor Mike Wood at San José State University. The project explores the application of deep learning techniques for car image classification. More specifically, it aims to train a neural network that can identify key visual features of a vehicle—such as its body shape, logo, and bumper contours—and use them to accurately classify the car’s make and model. The ability to perform reliable car classification has wide-ranging applications in traffic surveillance, insurance assessment, and autonomous driving. The project focuses on building and evaluating a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch to establish a strong baseline for vehicle recognition.
